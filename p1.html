                <p>Our project used the UE5 game engine to build the VR caen lab (BBB 1695). While trying to recreate the real scene (visual and auditory), we also added many interactive elements (lights, fire alarm, whiteboard, trash can, NPC character
                    dialogues, passerby) to make it more close to reality. In addition, in order to increase the fun, we added "robot" related theme elements, I believe you can see in our demo video.</p>
                <p>The innovation and difficulty of this project is that we created an intelligent robot "Nono", which displays a welcome message at the beginning of the game, and follows the player throughout the game and automatically adjusts the angle
                    of itself and its dialogue text when the player moves. It can do the following functions through the menu buttons: 1. Tips: it can suggest to the player the nearest object that can be interacted with through dialogues; 2. Light: it
                    can control all the lights on and off; 3. Fire alarm: it can control the fire alarm on and off; 4. Time: (the most difficult point) it can calculate the current time by the height of the sun in the scene, and the time passing can be
                    achieved by interacting with the object. . "Nono", the menu and the dialogue will be adjusted with the player's position to the direction and position.</p>
