                <p>Our project uses the Unity game engine to build an AR game: Plants vs Pokemon Zombies, based on the popular mobile AR game Pokemon Go, with the main story line of catching Pokemon with a Pokemon ball creatively adapted to the famous Plants
                    vs Zombies: planting and throwing plants to Plant and throw plants to repel the invasion of zombies, so as to protect our "Tree City" Ann Arbor.</p>
                <p>The basic gameplay is similar to Pokemon Go, with two modes: Exploration and Interaction. the former provides a map that uses a GPS system to track the player's movement on the map and allows the player to freely explore the city and visit
                    some of its attractions; the latter is an AR scenario in which the player can grow plants and work with them to defend against the invasion of zombies.</p>
                <p>The innovation of this project is that, unlike Pokemon Go, we can not only repel zombies by throwing them, but also launch attacks by growing plants, just like the real Zombies game, but it is AR. Such a feature makes the game more exciting:
                    failure to successfully repel zombies may result in our plants being eaten. At the same time, the zombies are more action-packed: in addition to the normal walking mode, the barrels on their heads and their arms will be knocked off
                    when they are injured, and there will be an animation in the end when they die - the same as in Plants vs. Zombies, which will do a good job of attracting otherwise PVZ players to play the game and will ensure that they adapt well.
                    In addition, another feature of this project is its potential for development: due to time constraints, we have only created one type of zombie and one type of plant that can initiate attacks, but in the future we can develop many
                    kinds of plants that have a good prospect of reverting to Zombies to a greater extent.</p>
